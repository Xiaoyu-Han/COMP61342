# COMP66090
Music Information Retrieval with Machine Learning


## Description
This project aims to combine music information retrieval techniques with machine learning. Advanced deep neural networks in machine learning are applied to the symbolic main melody extraction task. The project focuses on studying and testing various recurrent neural networks to detect the performance of different deep learning network architectures in the task of extracting main melody lines from symbolic music data.
